<h1>INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSIGNMENT 1</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<h4>Name: Oscar</h4>
<h4>Student number: s3900120</h4>
<h4>Student email address: s3900120@student.rmit.edu.au</h4>
<h2>Background Information</h2>
<h4>I was born in Australia, however, my parents are Taiwanese so I grew up speaking Mandarin at home. I went to Scotch College for high school. I have a few hobbies such as playing video games (League of Legends), basketball and gym, but my favourite is probably the gym. I enjoy going to the gym because it helps me to relieve stress and it also feels very rewarding to see the results of all the hard work when you look at yourself.</h4>
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<h4>My interest in IT started when I was a kid  in primary school, I was exposed to videogames on electronics like the DS, playstation 2, ipad, PS Vita and so I have always been more of a nerdy person ever since I was a kid. However, I feel like my interest in IT really started when my brother introduced me to League of Legends.I remember playing it for the first time,it was also the first time that I used an actual computer.
I chose to study at RMIT because I heard that the IT courses at RMIT are one of the better ones compared to other universities (like Deakin, Swinburne, la Trobe, Monash, Melbourne).RMIT is known for teaching content to students that specializes in more industry-based and practical skills which sounded good to me, as that is what employers value. Also, I wanted to go to the city for uni.</h4>
