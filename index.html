<h1>INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSIGNMENT 1</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
Name: Oscar
Student number: s3900120
Student email address: s3900120@student.rmit.edu.au
<h2>Background Information</h2>
I was born in Australia, however, my parents are Taiwanese so I grew up speaking Mandarin at home. I went to Scotch College for high school. I have a few hobbies such as playing video games (League of Legends), basketball and gym, but my favourite is probably the gym. I enjoy going to the gym because it helps me to relieve stress and it also feels very rewarding to see the results of all the hard work when you look at yourself.<
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My interest in IT started when I was a kid  in primary school, I was exposed to videogames on electronics like the DS, playstation 2, ipad, PS Vita and so I have always been more of a nerdy person ever since I was a kid. However, I feel like my interest in IT really started when my brother introduced me to League of Legends.I remember playing it for the first time,it was also the first time that I used an actual computer.</li>
  <li>I chose to study at RMIT because I heard that the IT courses at RMIT are one of the better ones compared to other universities (like Deakin, Swinburne, la Trobe, Monash, Melbourne).RMIT is known for teaching content to students that specializes in more industry-based and practical skills which sounded good to me, as that is what employers value. Also, I wanted to go to the city for uni.</li>
  
</ul>  

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=545f93a8a6a611de&tk=1f215eahb3ede001&from=serp&vjs=3">Ideal Job</a>

This job interests me because I have an interest in IT as well as banking, so working in a bank with IT skills would be pretty ideal for me. The skills that I would need would be being able to program and write in python and spark SQL as stated in the job description and also perform data analysis. Currently I do not know how to do any of this, so it is something that I will need to work on and learn how to do. Coincidentally, I am learning to code in Python in my ‘Introduction to programming class’ and also learning how to use SQL in ‘Practical database concepts’.

![big 5 personality test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81346328/112976759-fc61e100-91a0-11eb-8a5a-e603dd401884.JPG)
  
In the third test it states that I am more of a tactile person, perhaps meaning that I am a more hands-on person who learns better by touching and doing, for example I remember things better through physical movement, which I think is true personally. For the second test the traits are Openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In this test I scored more highly on openness, agreeableness and neuroticism, which suggests that I am a more open-minded person who is interested and open to others’ ideas. In the Myers-Briggs test I scored 88% for prospecting, apparently meaning that I offer a great deal of creativity and productivity.

The fact that I am a very open-minded and agreeable person is good because it will mean that I will be able to work with others well and I will be able to understand what my other group members ideas and thinking. Apparently I am a very creative and productive person, meaning that I will be able to get what is needed to be done and  bring new ideas to the group with my creativeness.


The Myer-Briggs test stated that I have an introverted personality which I also think is true, this means that I should look for other team members who are perhaps more outgoing to counteract my introvertedness.

<h4>Project Idea</h4>
My project idea is a program/application that gives you a visual representation of your physique so that you can look at and know how different items of clothing will look like on you. You will give the program measurements of your body (e.g height, arm length and width, shoulder width, leg length etc) and it will use the measurements to form a representation of your body so that you can see how pieces of clothing fit on you. This will also mean that the measurements of the clothing will need to be taken into account.

My motivation for this project came from my experiences with online shopping. Sometimes when I buy items online, it might look different in real life compared to what it looked like on the website and it might fit weirdly. Also, different stores have different cutting for their clothing, for example a size ‘Large’ might be smaller or bigger than other stores ‘Large’, so by having a program that shows you what you would look like, it eliminates the downside of online shopping which is not being able to see the clothing in person and trying it on.

In order for the program to work properly, users will have to give quite a number of body measurements, because ideally, the more measurements, the more accurate the representation will be. Measurements will be length and size (tape around)
Example measurements might be:

<ul>
  <li>Arm length and size (shoulder to elbow)</li>
  <li>Forearm length and size (elbow to wrist)</li>
  <li>Neck length and size</li>
  <li>Chest size</li>
  <li>Shoulder size</li>
  
  </body>
</html>
  <li>Torso length (neck to waist)</li>
  <li>Upper, middle, lower stomach size</li>
  <li>Waist size</li>
  <li>Upper, middle, lower stomach size</li>
  <li>Upper leg length and size (waist to knee)</li>
  <li>Lower leg length and size (knee to ankle)</li>
</ul>

Additionally, the program will also take into account for other features because people are built differently and have different structures. 
Some of these features might be:

<ul>
  <li>The amount of slouch in your spine</li>
  <li>The position of your arms in relation to your body</li>
  <li>The direction that your legs and feet point</li>
  <li>The position of your head in relation to your body</li>
</ul>
A slidable bar will represent the degree of these features.

Main features of the program:

<ul>
  <li>The program will give a 3D view of your body, meaning that you will be able to see yourself from different perspectives, ideally like a click and drag feature that rotates your model so that users can see what they will look like from different perspectives.</li>
  <li>The program will allow for the user to move body parts of the model to see what it would look like in different positions, instead of just having a model that just stands straight in one position.</li>
  <li>The program will allow the user to make the model do things so that the users can see what it will look like when they are doing those things, for example walking, sitting down.</li>
  <li>The program will allow for users to have several models so that they can save different outfits.</li>
  <li>The program will calculate the total cost of a certain outfit
.</li>
</ul>

This project will require programmers to develop an application and if it is successful, the outcome will be that online shopping will become a better experience for people as there will be less cases where customers are not satisfied with a product they bought because it looked different to what it did online or a piece of clothing fitted differently on them then how they thought it would.
